# 🪙 Coin Mining Simulation

This project is a simulation of a basic **blockchain mining process**, developed as part of our mini-project. It demonstrates how new blocks are added to a blockchain using a proof-of-work algorithm.

---

## 📌 Features

- Simulates block creation and hashing  
- Implements proof-of-work mining logic  
- Demonstrates how blockchain integrity is maintained  
- User-friendly code structure for learning and demonstration

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python (or your preferred language)
- SHA-256 hashing
- Command-line interface
